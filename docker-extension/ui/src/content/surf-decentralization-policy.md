#### General Provisions
This Surf Decentralization Policy (the "Policy") governs your use of the mobile application and web versions of Surf (Hereinafter, collectively "Surf") and the services offered by Surf (the "Service" or the "Services"). The web version of Surf is available at [ever.surf](https://ever.surf) and the mobile application is published in the AppStore and Google Play.

Surf is a TON smart contract wallet featuring support for decentralized bots ("DeBots"). It can act as a TON operating system ("TON OS") user environment as it supports an end-to-end decentralization (E2ED) framework.

Please carefully read this Policy to understand the definitions of Surf, Free TON Blockchain, TON, TON OS, E2ED and DeBots, including Surf's personal data processing guidelines.

This Policy can be published in different languages for localization purposes, but in case of any discrepancies between the English version and the version in a language other than English, the English version shall always prevail.

<a name='use-of-surf' id='use-of-surf'></a>
#### Use of Surf
As a user of the Services you have a limited, personal, non-commercial, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and a potentially revocable license to use Surf. Surf users are required to follow some basic rules, including, but not limited to, never using Surf for illegal purposes. You further agree to comply with any and all applicable laws and regulations when using Surf. This includes any local, provincial, state, federal, national, or international laws that may apply to you.

You agree that you shall not use the Services to pay for, support, or otherwise engage in any illegal activities, including but not limited to, illegal gambling, fraud, money laundering, or terrorist activities.

You further agree not to encourage or induce any third party to engage in any of the aforementioned activities as prohibited under this section.

Free TON Blockchain is a departure from usual blockchain designs. It is your responsibility to learn and understand how Free TON Blockchain operates in order to protect your digital assets and safely navigate through the various and diverse features of TON (The Open Network).

Free TON Blockchain is designed on TON technology.

Unlike other blockchains, TON associates all wallet addresses with a computer code. For purposes of this Policy, this code will be referred to as a "Smart Contract". Please remember that every transaction is an execution of a Smart Contract code by the blockchain. In this sense, Free TON Blockchain is more of a distributed computer than a record keeper.

TON utilizes several native cryptocurrencies or TON currencies. Collectively they are the Currency Collection. The base cryptocurrency of the Free TON Blockchain is the "TON Crystal" or the "TON" that is necessary to operate since it is used to charge Gas fees as described below.

All TON interactions send and receive Messages. For example, to send someone digital assets you need to create a message, sign it with your cryptographic key(s), and then send it to a Smart Contract that holds those digital assets. This Smart Contract executes the instructions dictated in the Message and transfers coins to another smart contract. Everything in TON is based on interactions between Smart Contracts.

A familiar and important type of Smart Contract is a Wallet. Unlike other blockchains, the Wallet is not the software on your phone or a computer that holds your cryptographic keys. TON Wallet is a Smart Contract stored and executed on the blockchain, by the blockchain, and in accordance with the instructions you send along with the Message.

It is critical to understand that Surf IS NOT a Wallet. Surf is client software that facilitates your interaction with Free TON blockchain by helping you do the following:

- safely create and manage Secret Keys (described below) on your device,
- deploy your Smart Contracts, including your Wallet Smart Contract,
- interact with TON Smart Contracts by creating, signing and sending Messages,
- interact with Decentralized Bots (DeBots),
- review and analyze events in Free TON blockchain,
- interaction with some of your system resources when necessary (such as access to camera when reading a QR code for example),
- provide other services.

By using Surf you acknowledge and agree that Surf DOES NOT STORE OR TRANSMIT DIGITAL ASSETS. Surf only transmits Messages. Any transfer involving any digital asset occurs on Free TON blockchain and not in any network owned by Surf or any of its affiliated companies. We do not guarantee that Surf can affect the transfer of title or right in any digital asset(s).

Once you submit a message via Surf it cannot be cancelled or otherwise modified. You must be certain that the Smart Contract associated with any transaction has enough digital assets to cover all necessary fees associated with the transaction prior to executing it. You acknowledge and agree that Surf and any of its affiliates shall not be held liable for any failed transactions.

<a name='secret-keys' id='secret-keys'></a>
#### Secret Keys. Master Password
Secret or private keys are crucial to your operations with regard to Free TON blockchain. They are used to sign Messages that interact with Smart Contracts in TON. THESE KEYS PROTECT ALL OF YOUR TON DIGITAL ASSETS.

To use Surf you must either import or create a private key. Creation of your private key is executed through the open source TON Labs SDK located only on your device and likewise stored only on that device.

Surf cannot hold, store, or recover your key(s). Surf has no way to recover your key(s) if you lose it/them.

You bear full responsibility for storing your private keys and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with those keys in a safe place where you can recover them; otherwise, you risk losing control over any and all digital assets that are associated with those private keys, forever.

Surf has no means to help you recover your password or secret key: SURF DOES NOT HAVE THEM!

All users, especially those with high value wallet balances, are highly encouraged to:
- Use the "Backup Password" function. Heres how:
    1. Navigate to the "Safety Protection" page of your Profile in Surf.
    2. Find the "Addresses and Keys" section where you can reveal your private key.

    Keys are a complex sequence of symbols. DO NOT try to write these down "as-is". You risk making a mistake and losing all of your digital assets.

- Use the "Backup Password" feature, Master Password. This feature provides you with a 12-word sequence (also called a mnemonic phrase). These 12 words are a mnemonic representation of your private key.
-Write this mnemonic phrase, Master password, down and store it in a secure location. You can always check if you wrote the phrase down correctly by using the "Saved, go check" button.

To further improve the security of Surf and of your digital assets, we suggest you:
- Use TON Labs Security Card with Surf to approve (sign) transactions. This security card adds another layer of protection to your private keys.
- Notify us of any irregular activity that you may encounter during your Surf.

<a name='security-card' id='security-card'></a>
#### TON Labs Security Card
One of the unique features of the Multi-signature Smart Contract is that it can require several signatures to send a message allowing Surf to work with TON Labs Security Card. Making them work together offers the following additional benefits:
1. Key anti-theft. Transfer of funds will require a secondary signature.
2. Safety of your digital assets even if your security key is compromised.
3. No need to transfer funds when changing your signature set.

Nevertheless, you will always remain the ultimate guardian of your security keys. Only you can be responsible for their loss, misuse, or disclosure. Surf can only assist you with the protection of your digital assets. Surf will not be held liable for the loss of your key(s). We only provide the software and are incapable of holding or storing the actual keys themselves.

Please be informed that TON Labs Security Card is a third-party service. Read carefully Terms and Сonditions in Surf. Your personal data can be asked by the third-party provider, processed and transmitted to external operators.

More information about TON Labs Security Card can be found at [card.tonlabs.io](https://card.tonlabs.io).

<a name='user-identity' id='user-identity'></a>
#### User Identity
Surf does not identify you, your device, your phone number, or any SIM card associated with your mobile device. Surf does identify you anonymously on Surf's backend to enable storage of your content only so you may be able to recover it from another device; however, this backup is encrypted with the same encryption used on Free TON blockchain. You acknowledge and agree that information associated with your Surf identity can be lost and Surf may not be able to restore it. Since Surf does not have your private keys we will not be able to decrypt any data associated with your security keys.

If you use third party services such as those obtained through buying or selling digital assets in exchange for fiat currency, any such third-party service provider may request your personal information or other information via Surf. In such cases you are responsible for reviewing their terms and conditions before accepting them. Surf shall assume no liability for your usage of any third-party services.

Third party services may not be genuinely decentralized; therefore, using any third-party services may expose you to identity disclosure that is out of the control of TON Labs, Surf, or any of its affiliated companies. Bear in mind that using these services may require:
- linking your real identity with your digital assets and Smart Contracts,
- enabling these third-party services to track your use of digital assets and Smart Contracts moving forward,
- enabling these third-party services to transmit your personal information to other parties, including, but not limited to, regulatory and law enforcement agencies,
- et cetera.

You hereby agree and consent to not hold Surf liable for any risks or losses associated with your use of any such third-party services.

#### End-to-End Decentralization
With the support of an E2ED interface, Surf operates as a TON OS user environment. TON OS is built on a E2ED concept that upgrades human-to-blockchain interaction to one of direct dialogue between the user and the smart contract. This dialog is enabled by decentralized bots (DeBots) that resolve the blockchain-human interface issue.

By using Surf you agree that Surf is only an interface to Free TON Blockchain, that, as mentioned above, consists of Smart Contracts. Surf neither controls nor determines content, function, or execution of those Smart Contracts. You acknowledge and agree that you shall assume all responsibility for interaction with Smart Contracts.

<a name='smart-contracts' id='smart-contracts'></a>
#### Smart Contracts
Smart Contacts are computer programs that are executed on the blockchain and verified by its consensus protocol to perform a so called verifiable computation.

As explained above, Surf is a Smart Contract client. In that sense, any true TON software is a smart contract client. Surf can manage any TON Smart Contract and interact with it, provided that it has a special declaration file, or the so-called TON ABI (TON Application Binary Interface). The TON ABI version that Surf supports is covered in TON Labs' official documentation available at [ton.dev](https://ton.dev).

By default, Surf deploys an ad hoc wallet smart contract from TON Labs (the "Multi-signature Wallet Smart Contract"). This Smart Contract is the first ever formally verified TON contract. Formal verification is a way to prove correct execution of a computer code.

Despite the above, no verification can prove and ensure 100% accuracy of software, and even if it were possible to do so, we cannot guarantee such accuracy.

<a name='debots' id=''></a>
#### DeBots
Decentralized bots (DeBots) are technology that enables E2ED at the user interaction level. DeBots allow Surf to draw the entire user experience without relying on a server. In other words, a DeBot is a Smart Contract UI. DeBot functions are programmed with TON ABI and operate on Free TON blockchain. Direct interaction with a DeBot triggers execution of functions in the underlying Smart Contract that is covered in the relevant ABI through a simple and familiar interface.

Since DeBots are decentralized, Surf neither controls nor determines content, function, or execution of DeBot scripts or the corresponding Smart Contracts. Given that a DeBot is a decentralized way to interact with a Smart Contract, everything that applies to Smart Contracts in this Policy likewise applies to DeBots.

<a name='push-notifications' id='push-notifications'></a>
#### Push Notifications
You can allow Surf to send you push notifications about any new events involving your DeBots. If you would like to receive push notifications, you must opt-in to the service in the “Settings” section by enabling “Push Notifications”. Provided by Google Notifications service, Push Notifications are outside of our direct control. Keep in mind that some third parties, such as mobile platform manufacturers, can view and analyze these notifications.

<a name='accuracy-of-user-information' id='accuracy-of-user-information'></a>
#### Accuracy of User Information
You represent and warrant that any information you provide in Surf is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that Surf shall not be held liable for errors or omissions you may make with regard to any digital assets transaction(s) initiated via Surf. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer digital assets.

<a name='taxes' id='taxes'></a>
#### Taxes
You agree to assume full responsibility to determine which taxes may apply to your digital assets, as well as to duly report such and remit same in accordance with your local, state, federal and/or international tax laws and respective tax authorities. You agree that Surf is not a qualified or licensed tax or accounting representative and shall not be held responsible in any way whatsoever for determining, collecting, reporting, withholding, remitting, or in any way otherwise assuming any responsibility for any taxes or tax information that may arise as a result of your participation in and use of Free TON.
