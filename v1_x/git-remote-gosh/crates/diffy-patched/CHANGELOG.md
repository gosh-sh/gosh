# Changelog

## [0.2.2] - 2022-01-31

### Fixed
- [#16](https://github.com/bmwill/diffy/issues/16) Fix an issue where patch
  files failed to parse when they contained hunks which were adjacent to one
  another.

## [0.2.1] - 2021-01-27

### Fixed
- [#9](https://github.com/bmwill/diffy/issues/9) Fix an issue where the incorrect
  range was being used to index an array when calculating a merge resulting in a
  panic in some cases.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-07-07
### Added
- Support for working with potentially non-utf8 data with the addition of
  various `*_bytes` functions.
- Support for writing both utf8 and non-utf8 patches into a writer `W: io::write`
- Support for a minimum supported rust version (msrv) of 1.36.0.

### Changed
- The `Patch` type is now generic across the text type, either `str` for utf8
  text and `[u8]` for potentially non-utf8 texts.
- The filenames for the original and modified files of a patch are now
  optional. This means that patches which don't include filename headers
  (only include hunks) can now properly be parsed.

### Fixed
- Quoted filenames which include escaped characters are now properly parsed.

## [0.1.1] - 2020-07-01
### Added
- `Patch`es can now be parsed from strings with `Patch::from_str`
- A `Patch` can now be applied to a base image with `apply`

## [0.1.0] - 2020-06-30
- Initial release.
